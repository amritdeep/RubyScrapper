https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=59814,"Clinical Social Work/Therapist, LCSW",Ms. Liz Margolies,"There are many good therapists listed here; the hard part is choosing the one with the best fit for YOU. Experience, location and even price are just the beginning. You need a therapist who understands what you are talking about, moves at your pace and has expertise in the issues you are working on.  Many of my clients are 27 - 40 yrs old, a time when people are working through the big life questions about love, work and sexuality.  It is common to become depressed, anxious or confused during this time.  Therapy can be a valuable tool.I work with a broad range of clients, but many come to deal with  depression, anxiety, work, family, sexuality, health, cancer and grief. While some of my clients are looking for an ongoing therapy process, I am also comfortable with short-term therapy that focuses on one particular pressing issue.It is important to me to have a warm and welcoming office. Mine is not overly formal. Most people work better in a room they find both comfortable and safe."

With the right therapist, you feel understood and safe to explore difficult issues. I am a warm and empathic listener who can help you gain insight into your life and give you tools to regain control. I received my doctorate from New York University and training in Psychoanalysis at the National Institute for Psychotherapies in NYC. Currently I am an adjunct faculty member & supervisor at NYU and a founding faculty member and clinical supervisor of Postgraduate Institute for Psychiatry & Psychoanalysis in Seoul, Korea.I have more than sixteen years of experience in helping people deal with anxiety, depression, and relationship issues.

I use my life experience to understand my clients.I am a Licensed Psychoanalyst as well as a Creative Arts Therapist. I focus on both verbal and nonverbal communication, and bridging the gap between the two.

https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=198283,"Clinical Social Work/Therapist, LCSW, CH",Ms. Mary J Sant Eufemia,"I believe one of the most important issues in the effectiveness of the treatment is in the relationship between the therapist and the client.  Once a trusting, empathic, confidential and non-judgmental environment is established, the client can proceed to honestly divulge information about themselves.  The more they are able to share, the more the therapist can help. Each client is seen as a unique individual and the approaches to treatment vary from one person to the next, whether it pertains to anxiety, depression, relationship issues, work related issues, PTSD, aging parents or a host of other difficulties.I am a Licenced Clinical Social Worker with 4 more years of Psychoanalytic Training.  As the field evolved towards short-term approaches, I too evolved into an Ericksonian Psychotherapist and Hypnotherapist in which the focus is on utilizing one's strengths towards the achievement of one's future goals.Since I have been in practice for over 30 years I have acquired an arsenal of techniques to use with each individual client and their difficulties.  So that the therapy is tailored to that particular client.  I have different locations and can offer internet sessions on Skype when necessary."
